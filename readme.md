# AslUtils

Utility scripts to parse ASL files and the actual ASL language.

To use the library:

1. Clone this repo somewhere on your system (from now on referred to as `/path/to/aslutils`)

1. Install antlr4 (manually or via the package manager of your choice)

1. (Optional) Setup a virtual environment in the directory of your python script: `cd /script/dir && python3 -m venv env/` and activate it `source env/bin/activate` (activation has to happen every time you want to use it).

1. `pip install -e /path/to/aslutils`
