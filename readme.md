# AslUtils

Utility scripts to parse ASL files.

To install and use the tool, preferably into a virtualenv:

1. Install antlr4 (manually or via the package manager of your choice)

1. (Optional) Setup a virtual environment from the working top level directory: `python3 -m venv env/` and activate it `source env/bin/activate` (activation has to happen every time you want to use it).

1. `pip install -e /path/to/aslutils`
